                 I am a second-year web developer, and I have recently 
                 built a small frontend project for fun using some frameworks.
                 It's impressive that you have built a small frontend project using Vue.js 3 with Vuetify. I'd be happy to play your game and answer any questions to test my knowledge or help you improve your knowledge.
                 i'll add more Question soon.
